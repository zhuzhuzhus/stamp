      <p>Before the history of stamps, mail delivery usually required payment of postage fees, but there was no unified
        standard or form to prove payment. This phase can be traced back to ancient times, where the payment methods for
        mail fees varied by region and country.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>The early stage of stamps (1840s-1860s) is considered the origin period of stamps. The most famous example is
        the Penny Black, the first postage stamp issued by the United Kingdom in 1840. Following that, other countries
        also began issuing their own stamps, making stamps the standard way to prove postage payment.</p>

      <p>The diversification phase of stamps (1870s-1930s) saw postal administrations creating a wider variety of stamps
        to meet different needs and commemorate events. Stamp designs became more diverse, featuring various patterns,
        colors, shapes, and materials. Stamp collecting also became a popular hobby during this period.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>The advancement of stamp printing technology (1940s-present) brought about more complex and precise stamp
